				<h2>Research Interest</h2>
				<p>I am interested in theoretical and basic research in wireless communications. 
					Specifically, I am interested in analyzing the performance of advanced 
					and emerging wireless techniques-enabled wireless systems, which are 
					aimed for future wireless communications. In particular, the main focuses 
					of my research are:
</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type:square">
						<li>Multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) technique for enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB)</li>
						<li>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for wide area Intenet of Things (IoT) systems</li>
						<li>Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technique</li>
						<li>Physical layer security (PHY-security)</li>
						<li>Cooperative transmission schemes</li>
					</ul>
